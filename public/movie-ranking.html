 <h1>The Best Movies According to Josh</h1>
 <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time, currently.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Fountain</h3>
 <p>I love the the ideas in this movie and this music is some of the best from Clint Mansell.</p>
 <h3>500 Days of Summer</h3>
 <p>This movie just speaks to me and how I felt my life went for a while. Always believing in true love or "the one". Joseph Gordon Levitt is one of my favorite actors and he shines in this movie.</p>
 <h3>Green Street Hooligans</h3>
 <p>Elijah Wood is very believeable in the role of an American getting involved in soccer (futbol) hooligans over the pond. Charlie Hunnam is so cool.</p>
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>The experience of this movie in the AMC IMAX is one that I will never forget. The sound and music is phenomenal. The visuals are awesome. The casting is perfect. And I love the story. It is just one of those movies that will always be at the top of my list.</p>
 <h3>Scream</h3>
 <p>It is just a classic movie and I love the whole series. I felt like it needed to be on here, representing the horror genre.</p>
